## What is Network Penetration Testing Tool?
Network Penetration Testing Tool is a website project designed to help Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) administrators test the security of their network devices. Users can input an IP range or specific IP address to scan network devices and identify open ports. The tool uses nmap for scanning and service version detection, as well as script scanning for various services such as MySQL, SMB, SSH, and HTTP.

In addition to scanning, users can set up a whitelist to identify devices that are not on the list and view a summary of the scan results. The summary provides valuable information such as the total number of open ports found, the most common open ports, the percentage of ports used for web traffic, the least common open port, the percentage of whitelisted devices, and the number of non-whitelisted devices that may pose a security risk. This tool aims to assist SME administrators in identifying potential vulnerabilities and improving their network security.
